Born a peasant on the southern Siberian steppe, Kalashnikov had little formal education and claimed to be a self-taught tinkerer who combined innate mechanical skills with the study of weapons to conceive of a rifle that achieved battlefield ubiquity. 

His role in the rifle's creation, and the attention showered on him by the Kremlin's propaganda machine, carried him from conscription in the Red Army to senior positions in the Soviet arms-manufacturing bureaucracy and ultimately to six  terms on the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's legislative body. 

Tens of millions of Kalashnikov rifles have been manufactured. Their short barrels, steep front-sight posts and curved magazines made them a marker of conflict that has endured for decades. The weapons also became both Soviet and revolutionary symbols and widespread instruments of terrorism, child-soldiering and crime. 

The general, who sometimes lamented the weapons' unchecked distribution but took pride in having invented them and their reputation for reliability, weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union to assume a public role as a folk hero and unequivocal Russian patriot. 


A Soviet nostalgist, he also served as the unofficial arms ambassador of the revived Russian state. He used public appearances to try to cast the AK-47's checkered legacy in a positive way and to complain that knockoffs were being manufactured illegally by former Soviet allies and cutting into Russian sales. 

A Soviet nostalgist, he also served as the unofficial arms ambassador of the revived Russian state. He used public appearances to try to cast the AK-47's checkered legacy in a positive way and to complain that knockoffs were being manufactured illegally by former Soviet allies and cutting into Russian sales. 

The weapon, he said, was designed to protect his motherland, not to be used by terrorists or thugs. "This is a weapon of defense," he said. "It is not a weapon for offense." 

Kalashnikov's public life resulted from a secret competition to develop the Soviet infantry rifle for the Cold War. The result was the AK-47 - an abbreviation for "the automatic by Kalashnikov" followed by the year the competition ended. 

Kalashnikov, a senior sergeant at the time who had been injured in battle against German tanks, was credited with leading the design bureau that produced the AK-47 prototype. The Soviet Union began issuing a mass-produced version in 1949. 

The true AK-47 was short-lived. It was followed in the 1950s by a modernized version, the AKM, which retained its predecessor's underlying design while reducing its weight and manufacturing time. 

Shorter than traditional infantry rifles and firing a cartridge midway between the power of a pistol and the standard rifle cartridges of the day, the Kalashnikov line was initially dismissed by US ordnance experts as a weapon of small consequence. It was not particularly accurate or well made, they said, and it lacked range and stopping power. 

It cemented its place in martial history in the 1960s in Vietnam. There, a new US rifle, the M-16, experienced problems with corrosion and jamming in the jungles, while Kalashnikovs, carried by Vietcong guerrillas and North Vietnamese soldiers, worked almost flawlessly. 

By this time, in an effort to standardize infantry weapons among potential allies, the Soviet Union had exported the rifle's specifications and its manufacturing technology to China, Egypt, North Korea and the Warsaw Pact nations. Communist engineers would eventually share the manufacturing technology with other countries, including Iraq.

   <h3 id="Tata Group to exit telecom business completely: Sources" >Tata Group to exit telecom business completely: Sources By Nisha Poddar, ET Now | 29 Jan, 2014, 01.47PM IST</h3>

In a big strategic shift at the Tata Group, Cyrus Mistry, a year after taking over as the chairman of the group, has decided to exit the telecom business completely, sources with direct knowledge share that the Tata Group has initiated talks with Vodafone to sell both Tata CommunicationsBSE 0.73 % and Tata Tele. Deal talks are at a "preliminary stage" sources point out. 

It will be a deal in various stages as both Tata Tele and Tata Comm have large shareholders with dominance on board decisions. Japanese firm NTT Docomo holds 26% in Tata Tele and has a put option which expires on March 31, 2014. Sources suggest that Docomo may give a one year extension to their put option to pave the way for a deal with Vodafone. ET had reported on Tata Tele-Vodafone deal talks on January 3, 2014. 

Government of India holds 26% in Tata Communications and as part of the deal negotiations with Vodafone, Tata Group will first buy out government's stake in the company and then sell to the UK based telecom giant. Talks between Tatas and the government have been on for a while. In the interim Tata Comm is selling it's stake in African arm Neotel to Vodafone's Vodacom. 

In response to an e-mail query sent by ET Now, Tata Sons' spokesperson said, "We do not comment on speculation." When ET Now contacted Vodafone, the spokesperson said, "No comment."

    SEATTLE: Microsoft Corp's board is preparing to name internal executive Satya Nadella as the software company's next chief executive, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources it said were briefed on the CEO search process. 

The board is also considering replacing Chairman Bill Gates, possibly with lead independent director John Thompson, Bloomberg said. 


Sources had previously told Reuters that Microsoft was down to a "handful" of candidates, including Nadella, executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise group, and Tony Bates, executive vice president of business development, plus at least one external candidate. 

Bloomberg added the Nadella plans had not been finalized. Microsoft declined to comment. 

Microsoft shares rose 0.8 per cent to $37.15 after hours, after gaining slightly in regular Nasdaq trading. 

Nadella, a native of Hyderabad, India, was promoted to run Microsoft's fast expanding internet-based computing initiative in July last year as part of current CEO Steve Ballmer's radical re-organization of the company.

Before that he was in charge of Microsoft's growing server and tools business, following on from high-level roles in Microsoft's Office and Bing search engine units. 

"He's a solid choice," offering continuity of strategy and proven execution, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen,

Some investors had campaigned for an external CEO who might be more likely to shake up the company and reward shareholders with greater dividends and share buybacks, but Parakh said that did not mean Nadella would necessarily be unpopular with Wall Street.


"Any new CEO is going to have to have the shareholders' say in mind. But it's not certain that will translate into actions," said Parakh.

There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from a group of investors who believe the company's co-founder is a block to radical change and investor-friendly moves at the technology giant. 

Some investors have urged Thompson to consider the CEO role himself, sources told Reuters this week. One person close to the board told Reuters on Thursday that Thompson was not in the frame to lead the company, but did not rule out a senior executive role, such as Chairman.

Microsoft's CEO search has taken longer than most expected when Ballmer announced his plan last August to retire within a year. 

In a blog post on the company's website in December, Thompson emphasized the need for a CEO with good tech bona fides and "an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent."

Thompson, who leads the four-member CEO search committee, said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision "in the early part of 2014." 

The appointment of a company veteran like Nadella, which follows a months-long search and long flirtation with outsiders such as Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Alan Mulally, could disappoint some investors who were hoping for a more radical transformation at the software giant.

Now that we have cheered ourselves hoarse over the elevation of an Indian to the top of the fourth-largest company in the world by market capitalisation, it is time to ask if there is anything to learn from Satya Nadella's rise 

Microsoft is full of brainy graduates of India's premier institutions of engineering, the IITs, besides graduates of the best schools of many other countries. Yet, Nadella, from a relatively humble Manipal Institute of Technology, has been chosen to lead Microsoft at a time of great challenge. Not that his engineering skills are in question. Rather, his non-engineering talents seem to have helped him vault over droves of talented nerds. 
Young Satya, we are told, was an all-rounder at school. He played a lot of cricket, played pranks, loved music, was a champion debater and a good student, but not at the top of his class. And he fell in love with, wooed and married a girl who was a junior both at school and college. This is not the picture of the ideal student most Indians have in mind: disciplined, focused souls who curb every natural instinct to explore the world outside their study material and are exemplars of filial piety, , especially when it comes to marriage. 

It is perhaps likely that such curbing of curiosity, rebellion and non-scholastic interests allows bright minds to game the tough entrance test for IITs, but robs them of, at least, a part of their creative instincts and ability to innovate and experiment. The new economy calls for not just hard-core technical skills but for the ability to think out of the box, to innovate and to take calculated risks. We need to ask whether the IIT culture is stripping some of our brightest youngsters of a major part of their potential.

We need many more quality educational institutions. Education itself must change from mastering texts to questioning knowledge as it exists, so as to create it anew, and to add to it. This calls for a change of culture in general, in how schools are run, in relative salaries of teachers vis-a-vis others. We need armies of toiling engineers, but we need our share of Nadellas, too.

     <h3 id="2013 sixth hottest year, confirms long-term warming: UN">2013 sixth hottest year, confirms long-term warming: UN By PTI | 5 Feb, 2014, 06.07PM IST </h3>
    <p>
    GENEVA: Last year tied for the sixth hottest on record, confirming that Earth's climate is in the grip of long-term warming, the UN's weather agency said today. 

"The global temperature for the year 2013 is consistent with the long-term warming trend," World Meteorological Organization (WMO) chief Michel Jarraud said in a statement 

Last year equalled 2007 as the sixth warmest year since reliable records began in 1850, with a global land and ocean surface temperature that was 0.5 degrees Celsius above the 1961-1990 average, the WMO said. 

Temperatures in both years were also 0.03 degrees Celsius above the average from 2001-2010, which in turn was an extremely hot decade, with 2005 and 2010 topping the warming charts. 

Those two years saw temperatures about 0.55 degrees Celsius above the long term average. 

Thirteen of the 14 warmest years on record have occurred in the 21st century, said the agency. 

Jarraud acknowledged that "the rate of warming is not uniform" in every country. 

Last year, for instance, was the hottest year on record in Australia, while the United States measured record highs in 2012. 

But, Jarraud stressed, "the underlying trend is undeniable." "Given the record amounts of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, global temperatures will continue to rise for generations to come," the WMO chief warned. 

"Our action, or inaction, to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases will shape the state of our planet for our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren." 

El Nino weather patterns, which warm surface temperatures, and their cooling La Nina counterparts are major drivers of natural variability in the climate. 

But the WMO said neither condition occurred in 2013. That year was warmer than both 2011 and 2012, which were cooled down by La Nina. 

El Nino occurs every two to seven years and last ended in May 2010, while the last La Nina faded away in April 2012. 

Neither is caused by climate change, but scientists say rising ocean temperatures caused by global warming may affect their intensity and frequency. 

"More than 90 per cent of the excess heat being caused by human activities is being absorbed by the ocean," the WMO said.

     <h3 id="After H-1B, US to take closer look at L-1 visa applications">After H-1B, US to take closer look at L-1 visa applications </h3>
    <p>
    BANGALORE: Visa applications by India's software services firms that get roughly half their revenue from work done at client sites overseas are likely to come under greater scrutiny this year in their biggest market, as the United States looks to tighten these rules. Infosys, Tata Consultancy ServicesBSE 1.42 % and other Indian IT firms will have to deal with site inspections by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) that now include holders of L-1 visas, the second most popular visas for Indian IT firms. 

Indian companies already face greater scrutiny of their H-1B visas, the most widely used short-term work permits by the $108 billion outsourcing industry, to outplace staff at client sites. Over the past two months, the USCIS has said it will inspect L-1 holders as well. For the IT firms, "it could open a Pandora's box", said Sheela Murthy, founder and president of Maryland-based Murthy Law, which specialises in immigration. 

"When they expand this programme, it could affect all employers, making it very hard for IT companies to send staff on L-1 visas," Murthy added. The USCIS has expanded the administrative inspections after a detailed report in August by the US Department of Homeland Security that made several recommendations on the L-1 programme. The report also pointed out that the top Indian IT companies, including USbased Cognizant Technology Solutions, and the Indian unit of IBM, the world's largest technology services provider, were among the top 10 L-1 beneficiaries from 2002 to 2011. 

Indian IT firms are also among the top beneficiaries of the H-1B short-term work visa programme and US immigration lawyers expect the current cap of 65,000 to be reached in a matter of days once the application window opens on April 1. Last year, the cap was reached in five days.

"This year India's top software firms are expected to apply for a higher number of L-1 and H-1B visas ... there is higher competition," said a lawyer who didn't want to be named. The Indian companies' use of these visas is already on the radar of US lawmakers, some of whom have proposed a ban on outplacement of H-1B visa holders, as part of a wider US immigration overhaul.


In recent years, especially during the recent extended period of economic uncertainty, Indian companies have had to deal with more rejections as well as delays on their visa applications. 


Last year, InfosysBSE -0.37 % paid $34 million to settle a US Grand Jury investigation into the Bangalore-based No 2 IT provider's past use of B1 business visas. USCIS' move to expand inspections could result in a higher number of L-1 visa rejections over the coming months, software industry and immigration lawyers said. 


"The number of L-1 visa rejections have increased in the past few years," said Rakesh Prabhu, a partner at Bangalorebased law firm ALMT. "These audits are a result of heightened scrutiny by the US," said Ameet Nivsarkar, vice president at Nasscom, the Indian outsourcing industry lobby. "Even the Senate version of the immigration bill calls for more audits and verifications," Nivsarkar said. 

The bill will likely be debated this year by the US House of Representatives, where lawmakers have said they will take a more piecemeal approach, looking at individual proposals. TCSBSE 1.42 %, Infosys and WiproBSE -1.16 %, India's top three IT firms, declined to comment. The work-site inspection programme is aimed at making L-1 visa applications fraud-proof and includes a visit by a visa officer to verify the information submitted by the employer and H-1B visas ... there is higher competition ..

     <h3 id="India warns US of consequences on visa reform on tech firms">India warns US of consequences on visa reform on tech firms By AFP | 6 Feb, 2014, 11.24AM IST  </h3>
    <p>
    
WASHINGTON: India has warned the United States of consequences for its companies if lawmakers tighten visa rules on high-tech firms as part of an immigration overhaul. 

Ambassador Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that India would see a decision to restrict certain temporary visas for skilled workers as a sign that the US economy is becoming less open for business. 

"We think this is actually going to be harmful to us. It would be harmful to the American economy and, frankly, it would be harmful to the relationship" between the two countries, Jaishankar told AFP in an interview. 

"Once I feel I'm not getting a fair deal, I am less responsive to the concerns of the other party. Then tomorrow if an American company comes and says, 'You know, we've got this set of problems,' the temptation for me is to say, 'I'm out for lunch,'" he said. 

The Republican leadership of the House of Representatives recently laid out general principles for an overhaul of immigration -- whose main goal would be to give legal status to the estimated 11 million undocumented foreigners in the United States. 

A version passed last year by the Senate, which is led by President Barack Obama's Democratic Party, offers automatic immigrant visas for foreigners who earn advanced science degrees at US universities. But it changes rules on so-called H-1B visas, which are issued to skilled workers who come temporarily to the United States. 

The Senate bill, while increasing the overall number of H-1B visas available, would hike fees and restrict additional H-1B visas for companies considered dependent on such foreign workers. The move came after complaints by US companies and labor groups that Indian tech firms bring in their own, lower-paid employees rather than hiring Americans. 

Jaishankar charged that the changes attacked the business model of India's showcase IT industry, which he said was making the US economy more competitive by helping companies operate round-the-clock. 

The ambassador said he raised his concerns in meetings with more than 25 members of Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, since he arrived in Washington in December. 


Another prominent lawmaker, Senator Orrin Hatch, recently called India "the biggest battlefield" for intellectual property rights and accused the country of "rampant piracy and counterfeiting" to benefit its own industries. 

Hatch made his remarks at the US Chamber of Commerce, which released a report that ranked India at the bottom of 25 countries in protection of intellectual property 

Jaishankar said he was "very surprised" by Hatch's remarks and charged that the pharmaceutical industry was driving criticism of India, with few complaints about intellectual property rights in other sectors. 

India has a major generic drug industry that produces cheaper copycat versions of life-saving branded medicines. But Jaishankar said it was incorrect to suggest that a "huge number of patents" was under threat. 

"I would very honestly describe it as scare-mongering tactics and, frankly, I don't think it's helpful," he said. "If there is an expectation that by doing this, we are setting ourselves up for a serious conversation, I think someone's got something wrong." 

"Affordable health care is the number one issue in the United States. There is almost a presumption here that what is a legitimate concern for Americans should not be a legitimate concern for Indians," he said. 

Jaishankar arrived in Washington amid one of the worst crises in years between the world's two largest democracies after authorities in New York arrested an Indian diplomat, Devyani Khobragade, on charges of underpaying her domestic servant and lying on her visa application. 

He said that India and the United States -- whose relationship has rapidly grown since estrangement during the Cold War -- shared common interests on security and political issues. 


"I would not assume that there's something structurally wrong or some revisiting of the basics of our relationship," he said.

    <h3 id="Indian IT companies face tricky Brazilian market">Indian IT companies face tricky Brazilian market </h3>
    
    <p>
    BANGALORE: Brazil's promise as a market as well as a near shore delivery location for Indian IT companies remains largely unfulfilled as the country struggles with economic and political uncertainty. 

Brazil, once seen as one of the fastest growing emerging economies, is fighting to revive its economy in a year it faces an election and plays host to the football world cup while preparing to host the Olympics just two years down the line. Indian players are also circumspect about South America's biggest nation where the twin challenges of language and local competition makes the market that much more difficult to crack. 

"The Brazilian market has turned out to be tricky for the Indian service providers. While some of them like TCSBSE 0.82 % and InfosysBSE 0.84 % have got it right, many others are still trying to cement their specific strategies," said Anupam Govil, a partner at Avasant, which advises IT services firms on market strategies. "The market is very expensive for nearshore delivery," said Ganesh Natarajan, vice chairman and CEO of Pune-based Indian outsourcing services provider Zensar Technologies.

Natarajan added: "A lot of companies (also) entered the market with the view of leveraging the domestic demand ... companies that entered the market two to three years back could not scale up and remained stagnant." 

According to the Brazilian Association of Software Companies (ABES), and research firm IDC, in 2012, the Brazilian software and services market touched $27.1 billion in revenues, and the exports were at $2.24 billion, growing by 26.7 per cent over previous year 

The domestic market for IT investments was said to touch $25 billion in 2013, growing over 10 per cent from 2012. Demand for IT from sectors including mining, retail, agriproducts and manufacturing remains largely untapped. 

This untapped demand, coupled with the IT needs of the World Cup and the Olympics seemed like the perfect mix. Most companies entered the market as it also offered a large resource pool and a stable and growing economy. All this, however, didn't pan out as the economy unravelled. 

Companies had also sought to take advantage of locally available talent in emerging technologies and multi lingual capabilities. For instance Tech MahindraBSE 0.65 % acquired a small firm ComplexIT that specialised in SAP's business management software. 

However, poor policy, especially during 2012-2013 by the ruling Workers Party which has been in power for over 10 years, has affected almost all key industries, in turn having a domino effect on the IT industry, Avasant's Govil said. According to the World Bank's latest Ease of Doing Business rankings, Brazil improved its position by two places only to reach 116 out of 189 economies in the Latin America and Caribbean region. 

"The market has lost some of its sheen," Avasant's Govil said. Infosys, which started in Brazil in 2009, has over 700 staff in the country. The company has only recently announced a small expansion, with a centre that will have 25 employees, serving a specific local customer Citrosuco.

    <p>

LONDON: Computers and robots will be more intelligent than humans and will be able to learn from experience, crack jokes and even flirt, within 15 years, Google's top expert in artificial intelligence predicts. 


Ray Kurzweil, Google's director of engineering, has predicted that by 2029, computers will be cleverer than humans and will be able to understand what we say and tell stories. 

Kurzweil, who invented devices such as flatbed scanners, computer programmes that could recognise a typeface, and text-to-speech synthesisers, is known for making bold predictions. In 1990 Kurzweil predicted that a computer would defeat a world chess champion by 1998 (in 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov), and he also predicted the future prominence of Internet. 

Kurzweil, 66, is recognised by technologists for popularising the idea of "the singularity" - the moment in the future when men and machines will supposedly converge. For years Kurzweil has been saying that the Turing test - the moment at which a computer will exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to that of a human - will be passed in 2029. 

"Today, I'm pretty much at the median of what artificial intelligence (AI) experts think and the public is kind of with them," he told 'The Observer'. "The public has seen things like Siri [the iPhone's voice-recognition technology], where you talk to a computer. They've seen the Google self-driving cars. My views are not radical anymore," he added. 

Google hired Kurzweil at the end of 2012 to work on the company's next breakthrough: an artificially intelligent search engine that knows us better than we know ourselves. Kurzweil said he is helping to bring natural language understanding to Google 

"My project is ultimately to base search on really understanding what the language means," he said. "When you write an article, you're not creating an interesting collection of words. You have something to say and Google is devoted to intelligently organising and processing the world's information.

    <h3 id="Cabinet hikes dearness allowance to 100%">Cabinet hikes dearness allowance to 100% By PTI | 28 Feb, 2014, 12.40PM IST </h3>
    <p>
    
NEW DELHI: Government today raised dearness allowance to 100 per cent, from 90 per cent, benefiting its 50 lakh employees and 30 lakh pensioners. 

The decision to hike DA for its employees, and to provide dearness relief for pensioners, by 10 per cent to 100 per cent was taken by the Union Cabinet in its meeting held her 

"The Union Cabinet has approved the proposal to hike Dearness allowance for its employees and dearness relief for its pensioners to 100 per cent in its meeting held here," a source said. 

This increase in the dearness allowance by the UPA-2 government comes ahead of the imposition of the model code of conduct by the Election Commission. 

The code is likely to come into force with the announcement of the schedule for the forthcoming general elections in a week or so. 

Also it would be the second double digit DA hike in a row. The government had announced a hike of 10 per cent to 90 per cent in September last year, effective from July 1, 2013. 

The new hike in DA would be effective from the January 1 this year. 

As per practice, the government uses Consumer Price Index- Industrial Workers data of the past 12 months to arrive at a quantum for the purpose of any DA hike. Thus, the retail inflation for industrial workers between January 1 to December 31, 2013 was used to take a final call on the matter. 

According to the provisional data released by government on January 31, the retail inflation for factory workers in December was 9.13 per cent.

An official had said earlier that the preliminary assessment suggests that DA hike will not be less than 10 per cent and would be effective from January 1.

    SAN FRANCISCO: Larry Page, Google's co-founder and chief executive, likes to talk about "big bets" and "moonshots." But the thing about moonshots is that they can crash to Earth. 

That appears to be what happened to Motorola Mobility, the cellphone maker owned by Google. The Internet giant announced Wednesday that it would sell Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 billion, less than two years after paying $12.5 billion to acquire it. 

Motorola was Google's biggest acquisition by far and was hailed by the company as an example of the big bets Page was unafraid to make. Yet Motorola has continued to bleed money, aggravating shareholders and stock analysts, and its new flagship phone, the Moto X, did not sell as well as expected. 

The deal is not a total financial loss for the extremely wealthy Google. In addition to keeping billions of dollars' worth of patents, Google essentially turned Lenovo into a factory for its Android operating system and also picked up some cash. Still, it is a sign of the fits and starts the company is experiencing as it navigates business in the mobile age, which has upended technology companies of all types. 

In addition to using Motorola's patents to defend itself in the mobile patent wars, Google pledged to reinvent mobile hardware with Motorola's new phones and directly compete with Apple by owning both mobile hardware and software. 

Yet while Google's business depends on phones getting into the hands of more people around the world, it benefits from selling the ads on those phones, not the phones themselves. Selling Motorola is an acknowledgment that Google is better off focusing on its core competencies - making software and selling ads - particularly as the profit margins for phones are shrinking overall. 

"They make their money from people watching YouTube ads and doing searches," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. "They don't necessarily need to be the hardware maker." 

Still, Google will retain about 15,000 of the 17,000 patents it acquired as part of its original deal for Motorola and will grant Lenovo a license to use certain ones. Analysts have described the patents as the most valuable part of the acquisition, worth several billion dollars alone because they are firepower for Google to defend its Android mobile operating system. 

Although the patents have not proved to be very helpful to Google in patent litigation, they have helped in cross-licensing agreements with other companies, including one Google and Samsung announced Monday. 

Google's share price climbed 2 percent in after-hours trading after the announcement, a day before the company was set to announce its fourth-quarter earnings.

"Motorola's been a millstone and a drag on results," Gillis said. "You're slipping the millstone off your neck." 

Lenovo, already the world's biggest PC company, is buying itself a toehold in the fast-growing smartphone business during a worldwide slowdown in PC sales and overnight brand recognition in the West. 

In an interview, Wai Ming Wong, Lenovo's chief financial officer, said the deal would feed the company's "PC-plus" strategy. 

"The Motorola handset business comes in very nicely to expand our business further," Wong said. 

Motorola, which has a storied history as the maker of the first commercial cellphone, more recently fell behind rivals like Apple and Samsung. Page announced the deal to acquire Motorola just months after he reclaimed his position as chief executive of Google, and he appointed Dennis Woodside, who previously ran Google's sales and operations, as Motorola Mobility's chief executive. 

Woodside said he would focus on just a few new phones instead of the old lineup of dozens. Yet the phones did not sell as well as expected, and Motorola continued to lose money despite drastic cost-cutting. 

The decision to buy Motorola was "the extravagance of being a company with over $350 billion in market cap," said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. "I'm not sure Motorola was fixable, and growth is much easier to come by on a company that's not a fixer-upper." 

Still, Page said Google remained committed to hardware, a business that it has been entering over the past couple years, most notably with Motorola but also with products like Google Glass and companies like Nest Labs, the maker of smart thermostats and smoke alarms that Google acquired this month for $3.2 billion. 


"This does not signal a larger shift for our other hardware efforts," Page wrote in a blog post. "The dynamics and maturity of the wearable and home markets, for example, are very different from that of the mobile industry."
